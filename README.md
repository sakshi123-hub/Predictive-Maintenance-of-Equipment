# Predictive-Maintenance-of-Equipment
Predictive maintenance using machine learning helps detect equipment failures before they occur, reducing downtime and maintenance costs. It analyzes real-time and historical data, including sensor readings like temperature, pressure, and vibration, to identify failure patterns. 

**Predictive Maintenance Using Machine Learning** focuses on minimizing industrial equipment failures by leveraging machine learning models. By analyzing historical and real-time operational data, predictive maintenance helps anticipate potential breakdowns before they occur, reducing downtime, optimizing maintenance schedules, and improving operational efficiency.  


### **Key Aspects of the Project:**
1. **Objective:**  
   - Reduce machine failures using predictive maintenance strategies.
   - Enhance model predictive capabilities through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

2. **Machine Learning Models Used:**  
   - **Decision Tree:** Chosen for its interpretability and structured decision-making approach.  
   - **Random Forest:** Selected due to its robustness against overfitting and improved prediction accuracy through ensemble learning.  
   - **XGBoost:** Preferred for its efficiency and high accuracy in handling large datasets.

3. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**  
   - Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and normalizing data.  
   - Feature transformation using **PowerTransformer** to stabilize variance and improve normality.  
   - Hyperparameter tuning with **Grid Search** to optimize model performance.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**  
   - Models were evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  
   - **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy (**97.91%**), followed closely by **XGBoost (97.70%)** and **Decision Tree (97.38%)**.  
   - XGBoost performed slightly better in identifying rare failure cases.

5. **Challenges Addressed:**  
   - Handling imbalanced data to improve rare failure detection.  
   - Selecting the most significant features to enhance model reliability.  
   - Optimizing hyperparameters to achieve the best possible prediction accuracy.

6. **Findings & Future Work:**  
   - **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** demonstrated strong potential for real-world predictive maintenance applications.  
   - Future improvements could involve **real-time monitoring, advanced ensemble models, and transfer learning** to adapt models to different industrial scenarios.


By integrating machine learning into maintenance strategies, industries can transition from **reactive maintenance (fixing issues after failure) to proactive maintenance (preventing failures before they happen),** leading to improved efficiency and cost savings.
